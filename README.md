*Have you ever despaired of filling hundreds of resumes by copying the list of publications and projects over and over again?*

This software allows you to save a considerable amount of time by replacing a list of publications, projects, etc. by means of a template. 
The software allows you to insert a header and a footer, and it is able to deal with regular expressions to eliminate fields that are not used.

An example is provided in the folder **example** for LaTeX and HTML output.
